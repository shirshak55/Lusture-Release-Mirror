Description: Lustre Server Linux kernel module (kernel _KVERS_)
 This package contains the loadable kernel modules for the
 ldiskfs filesystem as used by the Lustre cluster filesystem servers.
 .
 Do note, that you will only need this, when you're running the
 node as a Lustre server. The package might also contain the ldiskfs
 module for use as a backing file system, in case it was enabled.
 In that case, you should also run a lustre-patched Kernel
 to achieve optimum performance. If you plan to run this with ZFS
 enabled, no kernel patches are needed at all.
 .
 These server modules provide and supersede the client modules, if they
 are compiled against same Kernel version.
 .
 These modules are compiled for the _KVERS_ linux kernel.
