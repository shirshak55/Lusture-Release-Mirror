.SH NAME
lfs migrate \- migrate files or directories between MDTs or OSTs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs migrate
.RI [ SETSTRIPE_OPTIONS " ... ] <" file "> ..."
.br
.B lfs migrate -m \fIstart_mdt_index
.RB [ -cHv ]
.RI < directory >
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Migrate OST objects or MDT inodes between MDTs and OSTs respectively.
.P
The
.B lfs migrate
command can be used for moving files from one (or more) OSTs to other
OSTs (e.g. for space balancing between OSTs, or to evacuate an OST for
hardware reasons), to change the stripe count or other layout parameters
of a file (e.g. to increase the bandwidth of a file by striping it over
multiple OSTs), or to move the file between different classes of storage
(e.g. SSD vs. HDD OSTs, or local vs. remote OSTs in different pools).
.P
In OST object migration mode, the command supports the same
.I SETSTRIPE_OPTIONS
listed in
.BR lfs-setstripe (1)
to specify the layout of the target file.  The migrate command differs
from
.B lfs setstripe
in that
.B lfs migrate
will copy the data from the existing file(s) using the new layout parameters
to the new OST(s). In contrast,
.B lfs setstripe
is used for creating new (empty) files with the specified layout.
.SH OST MIGRATE OPTIONS
For OST object migration, there additional options available:
.TP
.BR -b , --block
Block access to the file by other applications during data migration
(default).  This prevents other processes from accessing the file during
migration, which prevents data data writes to the old file objects from
being lost.  This should be used if an OST needs to be completely emptied
prior to its removal, to ensure all requested files are migrated off the
OST.
.TP
.BR -n , --non-block
Abort migration if concurrent file access is detected.  This can be
used with OST space balancing migration to avoid interfering with file
access by applications if there is not a requirement to migrate any
particular file to the new layout.
.TP
.BR -D , --non-direct
Do
.B not
use
.B O_DIRECT
read and write operations when migrating a file.  The
.B O_DIRECT
option avoids data copy from kernel buffers into userspace, which can
impose CPU and memory overhead on the copy operation, but makes read and
write operations synchronous.  Using the
.B --non-direct
option uses buffered read/write operations, which may improve migration
speed at the cost of more CPU and memory overhead.
.P
NOTE:
.B lfs migrate
has a complementary
.B lfs_migrate
script which is used to provide extra functionality when migrating file
data between OSTs and has a separate man page.  See
.BR lfs_migrate (1)
for details.
.SH MDT MIGRATE OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -m , --mdt-index=\fIstart_mdt_index\fR
Directory will be migrated to MDTs starting with
.I start_mdt_index
, or specific MDTs if multiple MDTs are specified in a comma-seperated list.
This is useful if new MDTs have been added to a filesystem and existing user or
project directories should be migrated off old MDTs to balance the space usage
and future metadata workload.
.TP
.BR -c , --mdt-count=\fICOUNT\fR
Directory will be migrated to
.I COUNT
MDTs.
.TP
.BR -H , --mdt-hash=\fIHASH_TYPE\fR
Use
.I HASH_TYPE
for the new layout.
.RS 1.2i
.TP
.B fnv_1a_64
Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV-1a) hash algorithm.  This provides
reasonably uniform, but not cryptographically strong,
hashing of the filename. (default)
.TP
.B all_char
Sum of ASCII characters modulo number of MDTs. This
provides weak hashing of the filename, and is suitable
for only testing or when the input is known to have
perfectly uniform distribution (e.g. sequential numbers).
.RE
.P
Only the root user can migrate directories.  Files that have been archived by
HSM or are currently opened will fail to migrate, user can run the same migrate
command again to finish migration when files are ready.  Both inode and
directory entry will be migrated.  During migration directory and sub files can
be accessed like normal ones.
.TP
\fIWARNING\fR
A migrated file or directory will have a new FID, and hence a new inode
number.  As a consequence, files archived by Lustre HSM that depend on
the FID as the identifier in the HSM archive cannot currently be migrated.
Having a new inode number may also cause backup tools to consider the
migrated file(s) to be a new, and cause them to be backed up again.
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs migrate -c 2 /mnt/lustre/file1
This migrates the file into a new layout with 2 stripes.
.TP
.B $ lfs migrate -E 64M -c 1 -E 256M -c 4 -E -1 -c -1 /mnt/lustre/file1
This migrates the file into a three component composite layout.
.TP
.B $ lfs migrate -m 0,2 ./testremote
Move the inodes contained in directory ./testremote from their current
MDT to the MDT with index 0 and 2.
