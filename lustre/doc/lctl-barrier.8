.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
.B barrier_freeze \fR{fsname} [timeout]
Set write barrier on all MDTs. The command will not return until the
barrier is set (frozen) or failed. With the write barrier set, any
subsequent metadata modification will be blocked until the barrier is
thawed or expired. The barrier lifetime is started when triggering
freeze and will be terminated when barrier thawed. To avoid the system
being frozen for very long time if miss/fail to call barrier_thaw, you
can specify its lifetime via the
.I timeout
parameter in seconds, the default value is 30 (seconds). If the barrier
is not thawed before that, it will be expired automatically. The command
can only succeed when all registered MDTs are available. If some MDT is
registered but goes offline, then the freeze command will fail. To check
and update current status of MDTs, see the command
.B barrier_rescan
in subsequent section.
.TP
.B barrier_thaw \fR{fsname}
Reset write barrier on all MDTs. After the write barrier thawed, all the
blocked metadata modifications (because of the former
.B barrier_freeze
command) will be handled normally.
.TP
.B barrier_stat \fR[--state|-s] [--timeout|-t] {fsname}
.br
Query the write barrier status, the possible status and related meanings are
as following:
.br
  'init': has never set barrier on the system
  'freezing_p1': in the first stage of setting the write barrier
  'freezing_p2': in the second stage of setting the write barrier
  'frozen': the write barrier has been set successfully
  'thawing': in thawing the write barrier
  'thawed': the write barrier has been thawed
  'failed': fail to set write barrier
  'expired': the write barrier is expired
  'rescan': in scanning the MDTs status, see the command barrier_rescan
  'unknown': other cases
.br
If the barrier is in 'freezing_p1', 'freezing_p2' or 'frozen' status, then
the lifetime remaining will be returned also. If no option is specified,
or both "-s" and "-t" options are specified, then the output format is:

  state: xxx
  timeout: nnn seconds

Otherwise, only the value ('xxx' or 'nnn') corresponding to the given option
will be printed.
.TP
.B barrier_rescan \fR{fsname} [timeout]
.br
Scan the system to check which MDTs are active. The status of the MDTs is
required because the
.B barrier_freeze
will be unsuccessful if any of the MDTs are permenantly offline. During
the rescan, the MDT status is updated. If an MDT does not respond the
.B barrier_rescan
within the given
.I timeout
seconds (where the default value is 30 seconds), then it will be marked
as unavailable or inactive.
