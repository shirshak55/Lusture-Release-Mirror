/**
 * OFD interval callback.
 *
 * The interval_callback_t is part of interval_iterate_reverse() and is called
 * for each interval in tree. The OFD interval callback searches for locks
 * covering extents beyond the given args->size. This is used to decide if the
 * size is too small and needs to be updated.  Note that we are only interested
 * in growing the size, as truncate is the only operation which can shrink it,
 * and it is handled differently.  This is why we only look at locks beyond the
 * current size.
 *
 * It finds the highest lock (by starting point) in this interval, and adds it
 * to the list of locks to glimpse.  We must glimpse a list of locks - rather
 * than only the highest lock on the file - because lockahead creates extent
 * locks in advance of IO, and so breaks the assumption that the holder of the
 * highest lock knows the current file size.
 *
 * This assumption is normally true because locks which are created as part of
 * IO - rather than in advance of it - are guaranteed to be 'active', i.e.,
 * involved in IO, and the holder of the highest 'active' lock always knows the
 * current file size, because the size is either not changing or the holder of
 * that lock is responsible for updating it.
 *
 * So we need only glimpse until we find the first client with an 'active'
 * lock.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there is no way to know if a manually requested/speculative
 * lock is 'active' from the server side.  So when we see a potentially
 * speculative lock, we must send a glimpse for that lock unless we have
 * already sent a glimpse to the holder of that lock.
 *
 * However, *all* non-speculative locks are active.  So we can stop glimpsing
 * as soon as we find a non-speculative lock.  Currently, all speculative PW
 * locks have LDLM_FL_NO_EXPANSION set, and we use this to identify them.  This
 * is enforced by an assertion in osc_lock_init, which references this comment.
 *
 * If that ever changes, we will either need to find a new way to identify
 * active locks or we will need to consider all PW locks (we will still only
 * glimpse one per client).
 *
 * Note that it is safe to glimpse only the 'top' lock from each interval
 * because ofd_intent_cb is only called for PW extent locks, and for PW locks,
 * there is only one lock per interval.
 *
