/**
 * This file contains implementation of PLAIN lock type.
 *
 * PLAIN locks are the simplest form of LDLM locking, and are used when
 * there only needs to be a single lock on a resource. This avoids some
 * of the complexity of EXTENT and IBITS lock types, but doesn't allow
 * different "parts" of a resource to be locked concurrently.  Example
 * use cases for PLAIN locks include locking of MGS configuration logs
 * and (as of Lustre 2.4) quota records.
